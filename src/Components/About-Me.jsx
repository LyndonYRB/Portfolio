       About Me
                <h4>Full-Stack Developer</h4>
                <p>            
Out of all my jobs/projects that I`ve done, the ones I enjoyed the most are the types that allow me to create or rebuild something whether it's art, communication equipment or code and the greatest joy I get is when I see someone engaged in the final product of my work. What drives me to transition to Software Engineering is the fact that I get to be part of an evolving industry where I get to exercise my creativity and my ability to break down and solve problems.
 My greatest strengths are my creativity and perseverance, I was told this by those who I served in the military with. When presented with a difficult problem I would break it down to small problems or I would seek out those who had the same issue to get their input, or I would just step away and take a break to clear my head and then an idea or solution would come to me.
As a team player I do my best to motivate those around me and to create a positive environment especially during the difficult times. One of the ways I do this is by showing my coworkers or fellow service members the comic Iâ€™ve been working on for years or one of my art works. When taking on a team project or a task I tend to take a backseat role if I feel the other members have a solid plan to execute the mission however if their methods are not working, I will jump in and take charge.
